# Simple Discord Bot Example in Convo
# This demonstrates basic Discord bot functionality

Say "Setting up Discord Bot..."

# Get bot token from environment variable for security
Let token be get_env("DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN", "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE")

If token equals "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE" then:

    Say "Example: set DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here"
    Stop

# Listen for messages containing "hello"
Define handle_hello with message:
    Let username be get_user_name(message)
    Return "Hello there, " + username + "! How are you today?"

Call listen_for_message with "contains \"hello\"", handle_hello

# Listen for messages containing "ping"  
Define handle_ping with message:
    Return "Pong! üèì"

Call listen_for_message with "contains \"ping\"", handle_ping

# Add a command for bot info
