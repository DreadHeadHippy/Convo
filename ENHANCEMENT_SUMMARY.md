# Convo Language Enhancement Summary

## üéâ Major Accomplishments

### ‚úÖ Core Language (COMPLETE & WORKING)
- **Lexical Analysis**: Complete tokenizer with 30+ token types
- **Syntax Analysis**: Recursive descent parser with proper precedence
- **Semantic Analysis**: Full interpreter with environment management
- **Data Types**: Strings, numbers, booleans, null
- **Variables**: Assignment and scoping
- **Arithmetic**: +, -, *, / with proper precedence
- **Comparisons**: greater, less, equals, not equals
- **Logic**: and, or, not operations
- **Control Flow**: if/else statements, while loops
- **Functions**: Definition, calls, parameters, nested functions
- **Scoping**: Proper variable scoping and environments

### ‚úÖ Advanced Architecture (COMPLETE)
- **AST Nodes**: Complete abstract syntax tree structure
- **Error Handling**: Runtime error reporting and management
- **REPL**: Interactive shell with help system
- **VS Code Integration**: Syntax highlighting and tasks
- **Testing**: 17 comprehensive tests (all passing)
